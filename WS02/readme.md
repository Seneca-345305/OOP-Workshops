# Workshop 2: Move and Copy Semantics

In this workshop, you work with a large dynamically allocated array of C++ Standard Library strings and compare the performance of copy and move operations on that collection.



## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have demonstrated the abilities to:

- retrieve records from a text file using an input file stream  object
- count the number of records in a text file
- monitor the time spent on a particular task using the `std::chrono` library
- implement **copy semantics** for a class with a resource
- implement **move semantics** for a class with a resource
- identify the processing-intensive operations in copy and move assignments



## Submission Policy

The workshop is divided into two coding parts and one non-coding part:

- *Part 1*: worth 0% of the workshop's total mark, is optional and designed to assist you in completing the second part.
- *Part 2*: worth 100% of the workshop's total mark, is due on **Sunday at 23:59:59** of the week of your scheduled lab.  Submissions of *Part 2* that do not contain the *reflection* are not considered valid submissions and are ignored.
- *reflection*: non-coding part, to be submitted together with *Part 2*. The reflection does not have marks associated to it, but can incur a **penalty of max 40% of the whole workshop's mark** if your professor deems it insufficient (you make your marks from the code, but you can lose some on the reflection).

The workshop should contain ***only work done by you this term*** or provided by your professor.  Work done in another term (by you or somebody else), or work done by somebody else and not **clearly identified/cited** is considered plagiarism, in violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.

Every file that you submit must contain (as a comment) at the top **your name**, **your Seneca email**, **Seneca Student ID** and the **date** when you completed the work.

- If the file contains only your work, or work provided to you by your professor, add the following message as a comment at the top of the file:

    > I declare that this submission is the result of my own work and I only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments. This submitted piece of work has not been shared with any other student or 3rd party content provider.

- If the file contains work that is not yours (you found it online or somebody provided it to you), **write exactly which parts of the assignment are given to you as help, who gave it to you, or which source you received it from.**  By doing this you will only lose the mark for the parts you got help for, and the person helping you will be clear of any wrong doing.



## Compiling and Testing Your Program

All your code should be compiled using this command on `matrix`:

```bash
/usr/local/gcc/10.2.0/bin/g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -g -o ws file1.cpp file2.cpp ...
```

- `-Wall`: compiler will report all warnings
- `-std=c++17`: the code will be compiled using the C++17 standard
- `-g`: the executable file will contain debugging symbols, allowing *valgrind* to create better reports
- `-o ws`: the compiled application will be named `ws`

After compiling and testing your code, run your program as following to check for possible memory leaks (assuming your executable name is `ws`):

```bash
valgrind --show-error-list=yes --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ws
```

- `--show-error-list=yes`: show the list of detected errors
- `--leak-check=full`: check for all types of memory problems
- `--show-leak-kinds=all`: show all types of memory leaks identified (enabled by the previous flag)
- `--track-origins=yes`: tracks the origin of uninitialized values (`g++` must use `-g` flag for compilation, so the information displayed here is meaningful).

To check the output, use a program that can compare text files.  Search online for such a program for your platform, or use *diff* available on `matrix`.




## Part 1 (0%)

This workshop consists of three modules:
- `w2` (supplied)
- `TimedEvents`
- `StringSet`

Enclose all your source code within the `seneca` namespace and include the necessary guards in each header file.



### `w2_p1` Module (supplied)


**Do not modify this module!**  Look at the code and make sure you understand it.



### `TimedEvents` Module

Design and code a class named `TimedEvents` that manages a **statically** allocated array of `Event` objects.  Your class predefines the maximum number of event objects at 10. The **instance variables** for your class should include:
- the number of records currently stored
- the start time for the current event (an object of type `std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point`; see documentation [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/time_point))
- the end time for the current event (an object of type `std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point`)
- an array of `Event`s of structure type. The structure should contain the following fields:
  - a string with the event name.
  - a string with the predefined units of time
  - the duration of the event (an object of type `std::chrono::steady_clock::duration`; see documentation [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/duration))


Your class includes the following member functions:
- a default constructor
- `startClock()`: a modifier that starts the timer for an event
- `stopClock()`: a modifier that stops the timer for an event
- `addEvent()`: a modifier that receives the address of a C-style null-terminated string that holds the name of the event.  This function will update the next time-record in the array:
  - stores into the name attribute the C-style string at the pointed to address
  - stores `"nanoseconds"` as the units of time
  - calculates and stores the duration of the event (use `std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::nanoseconds>()`, see documentation [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/duration/duration_cast))
- a **friend insertion operator** that receives a reference to an `std::ostream` object and a `TimedEvents` object. This operator should insert in the `std::ostream` object the records from the array in the following format:

  ```
  Execution Times:
  --------------------------
  EVENT_NAME DURATION UNITS
  EVENT_NAME DURATION UNITS
  ...
  --------------------------
  ```

  The **name** of the event should be in a field of size 21, aligned on the left; the **duration** should be in a field of size 13, aligned on the right.

Starting and stopping the timer means getting the current time (use `std::chrono::steady_clock::now()`; see documentation [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/steady_clock/now)).



### `StringSet` Module


Design and code a class named `StringSet` that manages a **dynamically** allocated array of elements of type `std::string`. Your class keeps track of the number of strings currently stored and defines the following member functions:
- a no-argument default constructor
- a 1-argument constructor that receives the address of a C-style null terminated string containing the name of a file from which this member function populates the current object. This function
  1. reads the file to count the number of strings present in the file (the record delimiter should be a single space `' '`)
  2. allocates memory for that number of strings in the array
  3. re-reads the file and loads the strings into the array.
- `size_t size()`: a query that returns the number of strings stored in the current object.
- `std::string operator[](size_t)`: a query that returns a copy of the string at the index received as the function parameter. If the index is invalid, this function should return an empty string.

To review the syntax for reading from a text file using an `std::ifstream` object see the chapter in your notes entitled [Input and Output Operators](http://intro2oop.sdds.ca/C-Encapsulation/input-and-output-operators).

Add any other members that your design requires (without changing the specs above)!



### Sample Output

When the program is started with the command:
```
ws gutenberg_shakespeare
```
the output should look like the one from the `sample_output.txt` file.

**Note:** The execution times will be different every time you run the program! Everything else should match.




### Test Your Code

To test the execution of your program, use the same data as shown in the output example above.
Upload your source code to your `matrix` account. Compile and run your code using the latest version of the `g++` compiler (available at `/usr/local/gcc/10.2.0/bin/g++`) and make sure that everything works properly.

Then, run the following command from your account (replace `profname.proflastname` with your professor’s Seneca userid):
```
~profname.proflastname/submit 345_w2_p1
```
and follow the instructions.

***This part represents a milestone in completing the workshop and is not marked!***










## Part 2 (100%)

For this part of the workshop, upgrade the `StringSet` class to include a **move constructor** and a **move assignment operator**.  No other modules need to be changed.

### Sample Output

When the program is started with the command:
```
ws gutenberg_shakespeare
```
the output should look like the one from the `sample_output.txt` file.

**Note:** See that in the sample output the *move operations* are **many orders of magnitude** faster than the *copy operations*.  If your output doesn't have such a significant difference in times, keep working on your implementation (the actual numbers will be different every time you run the application).


### Reflection

Study your final solution, reread the related parts of the course notes, and make sure that you have understood the concepts covered by this workshop. **This should take no less than 30 minutes of your time and the result is suggested to be at least 150 words in length.**

Create a **text** file named `reflect.txt` that contains your detailed description of the topics that you have learned in completing this particular workshop and mention any issues that caused you difficulty and how you solved them. Include in your explanation—**but do not limit it to**—the following points:
- the reason for the significant time difference between the copy and move operations
- describe approach taken to read the input file (`gutenberg_shakespeare`) in the `StringSet` constructor and populate the dynamic array. Is there any way to avoid rereading the file?
- in the links above to `chrono` library, you were directed to use a `steady_clock` to take a timestamp.  Do some research and explain the difference between a `steady_clock` and a `system_clock`.  Are they the same? When should each one be used?

To avoid deductions, refer to code in your solution as examples to support your explanations.





### Submission

To test and demonstrate execution of your program use the same data as shown in the output example above.

Upload the source code and the reflection file to your `matrix` account. Compile and run your code using the latest version of the `g++` compiler (available at `/usr/local/gcc/10.2.0/bin/g++`) and make sure that everything works properly.

Then, run the following command from your account (replace `profname.proflastname` with your professor’s Seneca userid):
```
~profname.proflastname/submit 345_w2_p2
```
and follow the instructions.

**:warning:Important:** Please note that a successful submission does not guarantee full credit for this workshop. If the professor is not satisfied with your implementation, your professor may ask you to resubmit. Resubmissions will attract a penalty.
